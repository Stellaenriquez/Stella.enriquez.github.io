            <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
            <p> In summer 2020, we were captivated by the thought of fulfilling someone's needs and interests through offering a high-end but affordable computer set. Well, we realized that it can help people in many ways, namely, it can lessen the struggles of the students, work-from-home workers can get their works done smoothly, and more. Additionally, due to modernization, gamers were born, so, a computer set is what they need. It may be a common saying but, indeed, technologies can make your work easier.</p>
